      Cubs Strike Out For Second Season In A Row

        <h1 id="Cubs-Strike-Out-For-Second-Season-In-A-Row"><a href="#Cubs-Strike-Out-For-Second-Season-In-A-Row" class="headerlink" title="Cubs Strike Out For Second Season In A Row"></a>Cubs Strike Out For Second Season In A Row</h1><p>The Chicago Cubs have not had a great season and they know it. The team’s management has made some big changes in order to try and turn the team’s performance around, but the players have not been able to deliver the wins. One of the biggest problems for the Cubs this season has been their inability to score runs. They have been one of the worst teams in terms of batting average and runs scored.</p>
<p>Part of the team’s struggles can be attributed to their lack of player leadership. The Cubs lost some key players over the offseason, including Dexter Fowler and David Ross. They also traded away Starlin Castro, who had been with the team since he was a rookie. These changes left a significant leadership vacuum on the team. Players such as Javier Baez and Anthony Rizzo stepped up to fill some of these roles, but they have not been able to carry the team to victory.</p>
<p>The Cubs are still in first place in their division, but they are in danger of losing their lead if they do not start scoring more runs. Their next few games are against teams that they should be able to beat, but they cannot take anything for granted. It is going to be important for them to stay focused and play as a team if they want to make it back to the playoffs this year.</p>
<h1 id="Wrigley-Field-Hopes-To-Provide-Winning-Atmosphere"><a href="#Wrigley-Field-Hopes-To-Provide-Winning-Atmosphere" class="headerlink" title="Wrigley Field Hopes To Provide Winning Atmosphere"></a>Wrigley Field Hopes To Provide Winning Atmosphere</h1><p>The Wrigley Field stadium, home to the Chicago Cubs baseball team, is in the process of being renovated. The hope is that this will provide a more positive atmosphere for the players and fans, and in turn lead to more wins.</p>
<p>The renovation project, which began in 2014 and is scheduled to be completed in 2021, includes new bleachers, a Jumbotron screen, an outdoor plaza, and other amenities. The goal is to make Wrigley Field more modern while still preserving its historic charm.</p>
<p>The Cubs haven’t won a World Series championship since 1908, the longest championship drought in Major League Baseball. But the fans are hopeful that with the renovations and improved team performance, this could finally change soon.</p>
<p>Wrigley Field has been around since 1914 and is one of the oldest stadiums in MLB. It’s also one of the most popular tourist destinations in Chicago. With its ivy-covered brick walls and traditional design, Wrigley Field is a landmark in both sports and architectural history.</p>
<h1 id="Epstein-We-Expect-To-Win-The-Division"><a href="#Epstein-We-Expect-To-Win-The-Division" class="headerlink" title="Epstein: We Expect To Win The Division"></a>Epstein: We Expect To Win The Division</h1><p>The Epstein message to Cubs fans Monday was clear: We expect to win the division.</p>
<p>This from the mouth of president of baseball operations Theo Epstein, who spoke to reporters at Sloan Park in Mesa, Ariz.</p>
<p>“I think we can win the division,” Epstein said. “I don’t know that we will, but I think we have a chance.”</p>
<p>The Cubs have not won a division title since 2008 when they topped the NL Central with a 97-64 record. In the ensuing eight seasons, they’ve finished third (twice), second (twice) and first (twice). The last time they made it to the playoffs was in 2015 when they were swept by the New York Mets in the National League Championship Series.</p>
<p>“We’re coming off a 95-loss season,” Epstein said. “There’s no hiding from that. We need to be better on offense, defense and pitching. We’re excited about our team. We feel like we have a chance to make some noise.”</p>
<p>Epstein is entering his fourth season as president of baseball operations for the Cubs. He spoke about how he expects Joe Maddon to manage the team this season and gave his thoughts on some of the players on the roster, including Kris Bryant, Javier Baez and Kyle Schwarber.</p>
<p>“Kris is an MVP-caliber player,” Epstein said of Bryant, who hit .272 with 13 home runs and 52 RBIs in 2018 after being named NL MVP in 2016. “He had a down year last year … we’re confident he’s going to bounce back this year.”</p>
<h1 id="Schwarber-Leads-Cubs-As-MVP-Candidate"><a href="#Schwarber-Leads-Cubs-As-MVP-Candidate" class="headerlink" title="Schwarber Leads Cubs As MVP Candidate"></a>Schwarber Leads Cubs As MVP Candidate</h1><p>No one could have predicted the success that the Chicago Cubs would have in the 2016 season. After all, they were coming off a disappointing year where they failed to make the playoffs. However, led by young stars such as Kris Bryant and Javier Baez, the Cubs were able to win 103 games and earn the top seed in the National League playoffs.</p>
<p>One of the biggest surprises for the Cubs has been outfielder Kyle Schwarber. Schwarber was drafted fourth overall by Chicago in 2014, but missed all of last season after tearing his ACL just two games into the year. Many people doubted whether or not Schwarber would be able to return to form this season.</p>
<p>However, Schwarber has silenced his critics by putting up some impressive numbers. He is currently batting .292 with 31 home runs and 76 RBIs. Schwarber has also been very good in the playoffs, hitting .308 with five home runs and eight RBIs.</p>
<p>Schwarber’s play has not gone unnoticed, as he is currently being mentioned as a potential MVP candidate. If he can continue to hit well in the World Series, there is no doubt that he will win some major awards this offseason.</p>
<p>Regardless of what happens in the World Series, it has been an incredible season for Kyle Schwarber and the Chicago Cubs.</p>
<h1 id="North-Siders-Hope-To-Reverse-Misfortune-in-2017"><a href="#North-Siders-Hope-To-Reverse-Misfortune-in-2017" class="headerlink" title="North Siders Hope To Reverse Misfortune in 2017"></a>North Siders Hope To Reverse Misfortune in 2017</h1><p>The Chicago Cubs were the toast of the town in 2016, as they finally broke a 108-year championship drought. But the party didn’t last long, as the Cubs were bounced in the first round of the playoffs by the Los Angeles Dodgers.</p>
<p>Now, the North Siders are looking to reverse their fortunes in 2017. The offseason saw key players like Dexter Fowler and Aroldis Chapman leave via free agency, but Chicago added some impressive talent in return.</p>
<p>Key additions include Jason Heyward, John Lackey and Ben Zobrist. The Cubs will also have Kyle Schwarber back from injury, and Kris Bryant is poised for another MVP-type season.</p>
<p>There’s no question that the Cubbies are one of the favorites to win it all in 2017. They’ll have to overcome some tough competition, including teams like the Dodgers, Washington Nationals and Boston Red Sox.</p>
<p>But if anyone can do it, it’s this talented group of Cubs players. They’re motivated to bring a championship back to Chicago - and they’ll be doing everything they can to make that happen in 2017.</p>
