        <h1 id="Boston-Red-Sox-Can’t-Win-Because-of-the-Curse-of-the-Bambino"><a href="#Boston-Red-Sox-Can’t-Win-Because-of-the-Curse-of-the-Bambino" class="headerlink" title="Boston Red Sox Can’t Win Because of the Curse of the Bambino"></a>Boston Red Sox Can’t Win Because of the Curse of the Bambino</h1><p>The Boston Red Sox became big league baseball’s most unsuccessful team after they sold Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees in 1919. The so-called “Curse of the Bambino” has been blamed for the Red Sox’s 86-year championship drought.</p>
<p>Boston’s misfortune began when the club owner, Harry Frazee, traded Ruth to the Yankees for $125,000. According to legend, Frazee did so in order to finance a Broadway show. But some believe that Frazee was actually bribed by the Yankees owner, Jacob Ruppert, to give Ruth to New York. In any case, the Red Sox have never won a World Series title since Ruth left town.</p>
<p>In fact, they came close only once. In 1946, they went 9-3 against the Yankees in the regular season and then took a 3-2 lead in the World Series. But New York came back to win games six and seven and capture its first championship since 1923.</p>
<p>The “Curse of the Bambino” was finally broken on October 27, 2004, when Boston defeated St. Louis in game four of the World Series. The victory marked an end to 86 years of frustration for Red Sox fans and launched a new era of success for the team.</p>
<h1 id="Boston-Red-Sox-Can’t-Win-Because-They’re-Not-Smart-Enough"><a href="#Boston-Red-Sox-Can’t-Win-Because-They’re-Not-Smart-Enough" class="headerlink" title="Boston Red Sox Can’t Win Because They’re Not Smart Enough"></a>Boston Red Sox Can’t Win Because They’re Not Smart Enough</h1><p>The Boston Red Sox have been one of the most successful teams in baseball for over a century. However, in the last decade they have failed to win a World Series, which many people attribute to their lack of intelligence.</p>
<p>The Red Sox are known for making bad decisions on the field, such as giving up crucial home runs or bases loaded walks. They also make mistakes off the field, such as signing players to expensive contracts who then turn out to be busts.</p>
<p>This lack of intelligence was best demonstrated in the team’s “Chicken and Beer” debacle in 2011. The team’s ownership decided to give players unlimited access to alcohol in the clubhouse, and the players responded by partying hard and playing poorly. As a result, the Red Sox missed the playoffs for the first time in 15 years.</p>
<p>While some fans may believe that the Red Sox’ lack of intelligence is holding them back, others argue that this is simply an excuse used by fans of other teams. The truth is that the Red Sox are simply a good team with a few bad players who are capable of winning a World Series if they play their cards right.</p>
<h1 id="Boston-Red-Sox-Can’t-Win-Because-They-Play-in-a-Tough-Division"><a href="#Boston-Red-Sox-Can’t-Win-Because-They-Play-in-a-Tough-Division" class="headerlink" title="Boston Red Sox Can’t Win Because They Play in a Tough Division"></a>Boston Red Sox Can’t Win Because They Play in a Tough Division</h1><p>In any sport, the team that plays in the toughest division will always have a harder time winning the championship. This is because they have to face tougher competition on a regular basis. The Boston Red Sox are a perfect example of this.</p>
<p>They play in the American League East division, which happens to be one of the toughest in all of baseball. In addition to the Red Sox, this division includes the New York Yankees, the Baltimore Orioles and the Tampa Bay Rays. All four of these teams are perennial contenders, which makes it very difficult for any one of them to come out on top.</p>
<p>The Red Sox have had some success in recent years, making it to the playoffs two out of the last three seasons. However, they have been unable to win the World Series, largely due to the difficulty of their division. In order to win it all, they will likely need to go through at least one (and possibly two) of their rivals.</p>
<p>This is not an impossible task by any means, but it is certainly more difficult than if they were in a weaker division. As long as they continue to play in the AL East, the Boston Red Sox will always be just a step behind the Yankees and Orioles.</p>
<h1 id="Boston-Red-Sox-Can’t-Win-Because-They’re-Fundamentally-Flawed"><a href="#Boston-Red-Sox-Can’t-Win-Because-They’re-Fundamentally-Flawed" class="headerlink" title="Boston Red Sox Can’t Win Because They’re Fundamentally Flawed"></a>Boston Red Sox Can’t Win Because They’re Fundamentally Flawed</h1><p>The Boston Red Sox will not be making the playoffs this year and it’s not because of their competition in the American League East. It’s because the Red Sox are fundamentally flawed.</p>
<p>Their starting pitching has been inconsistent all year long with Chris Sale, David Price and Rick Porcello all having ERAs over 4.00. The bullpen has also been a mess with Craig Kimbrel losing his closer role and Carson Smith out for the year.</p>
<p>Offensively, they have been led by Mookie Betts and J.D. Martinez but they both got off to slow starts. Betts is currently hitting just .259 while Martinez is hitting .269. Xander Bogaerts, who was supposed to take a step forward this season, is hitting just .240.</p>
<p>And finally, their defense has also been a liability with Gold Glove winners Jackie Bradley Jr. and Dustin Pedroia both having below-average seasons defensively.</p>
<p>So, what can the Red Sox do to fix their problems?</p>
<p>Well, they could start by trading Kyrie Irving and getting some good starting pitching in return. Irving has made it clear that he wants out of Boston and the team would be better off without him anyway. They could also try to trade for Mike Trout or Bryce Harper in the offseason which would give them one of the best lineups in baseball.</p>
<p>But ultimately, it may be too late for the Red Sox to fix their problems this season. They are currently 10 games out of first place and 8 games out of the second Wild Card spot.</p>
<h1 id="Boston-Red-Sox-Can’t-Win-and-It’s-All-George-Steinbrenner’s-Fault"><a href="#Boston-Red-Sox-Can’t-Win-and-It’s-All-George-Steinbrenner’s-Fault" class="headerlink" title="Boston Red Sox Can’t Win and It’s All George Steinbrenner’s Fault"></a>Boston Red Sox Can’t Win and It’s All George Steinbrenner’s Fault</h1><p>Boston Red Sox owner John Henry recently came out and said that the team’s struggles over the past few years are not his fault, but rather George Steinbrenner’s. This article will explore why Boston Red Sox owner John Henry is wrong, and how the team’s failure is actually his own fault.</p>
<p>For starters, it should be noted that the Boston Red Sox have failed to make the playoffs in each of the last three seasons. This is simply unacceptable for a team with as much talent as the Red Sox boast. In addition, they have only won one World Series championship in the past ten years. Clearly, something has been going wrong in Boston and it’s not all George Steinbrenner’s fault.</p>
<p>Boston Red Sox owner John Henry has pointed to two main reasons for the team’s failures: their inability to win key games late in the season and their lack of a “true ace” pitcher. With respect to their inability to win key games late in the season, it is worth noting that Boston has only had one losing record in September over the past ten years. In fact, they have had more winning records than losing records in September during that time period. So, it is hard to blame their recent failures on their performance during September.</p>
<p>As for their lack of a “true ace” pitcher, it is worth noting that Boston has actually had some very good pitchers over the past few years. In fact, Jon Lester and Clay Buchholz have both been Cy Young Award finalists during their time with the team. In addition, David Price was just signed by the Red Sox this offseason and he is considered one of the best pitchers in baseball. Clearly, then, Boston’s lack of a “true ace” pitcher cannot be blamed for their recent failures.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Boston Red Sox owner John Henry is wrong to say that George Steinbrenner is responsible for his team’s failures over the past few years. Rather, those failures are squarely on Henry’s shoulders and he needs to take responsibility for them.</p>
