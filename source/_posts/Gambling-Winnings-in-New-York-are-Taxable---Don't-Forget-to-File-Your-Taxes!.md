#  New York Slots Revenue Up, But Gambling Winnings Still Taxable 

According to the latest figures from the New York State Gaming Commission, casino slot machine revenue was up by $320 million in the fiscal year that ended on March 31, 2018, compared to the previous fiscal year. However, while gambling winnings are taxable income in New York, there is no specific tax levied on slot machine revenues.

The upswing in slot machine revenue was driven in part by a new $1 bet limit that was implemented in late 2016. The commission also attributed the increase to enhancements made to the gaming floor at Aqueduct Racetrack and Resorts World Casino New York City. In total, gambling winnings amounted to $2.48 billion in the most recent fiscal year, of which $1.47 billion came from slot machines.

While there is no special tax on slot machine revenue, gamblers are still required to pay taxes on their winnings. Gambling income is subject to normal income tax rates, which range from 4% to 8.82%. In addition, there is a state surcharge of 8.82% on all gambling winnings over $5,000. This means that a gambler who wins $10,000 would have to pay almost $1,200 in taxes.

Despite the uptick in slot machine revenue, it still accounts for only a small fraction of total state tax revenue. In the most recent fiscal year, gambling taxes accounted for just 0.5% of all state tax revenue.
