#  Slot Machine Gets Printer Communication to Better Serve Customers 

\
Las Vegas, Nevada - Slot machine maker Aruze Gaming has announced a new printer communication system that will allow customers to print out their winnings directly from the machines. The new system is aimed at improving customer service and convenience.

Aruze Gaming's new printer communication system consists of three parts: a printer in the casino cage, a printer in the slot machine, and a server. The server communicates with both printers, allowing customers to print out their winnings from anywhere in the casino.

The new system was developed in response to customer feedback. "We've been listening to our customers and they've told us that they want the convenience of being able to print out their winnings right from the machines," said Aruze Gaming CEO Hiroyuki Onoda. "With our new printer communication system, we're giving our customers what they want."

The new system is expected to be rolled out in casinos worldwide later this year.

#  Slot Machine Manufacturers Adds Printer Communication for Improved Customer Service

A new development announced by Slot Machine Manufacturers will allow slot machine owners to communicate with printers directly in order to improve customer service. The announcement was made at the Global Gaming Expo (G2E) in Las Vegas.

"This is a game changer for casino operators," said Joe Weinert, senior vice president of Spectrum Gaming Group. "The ability to print reports and other information immediately at the slot machine rather than having to wait for a technician to arrive on site can save time and money."

The printers will be placed in cabinets near the machines and will be able to print out documents in both color and black-and-white. Operators will be able to send messages to the printers from their computers or from mobile devices.
