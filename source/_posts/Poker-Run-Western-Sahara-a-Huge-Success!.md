The event began with a group ride through the picturesque nature reserve, followed by a stop at the reserve's beach for some swimming and relaxation. After that it was on to the poker tournament, where participants competed for prizes in several different categories.

In the end, it was Mohamad Djimi who walked away with first prize in the main tournament, while Abdelilah Assimi took home the prize for best hand. Best overall rider went to Boujamaa Moustafa, and best overall driver to Ahmed Adil.

#  Poker Run Western Sahara Raises Money for Charity

On September 10th, a group of about 100 people participated in a "Poker Run" through the Western Sahara. The event was organized by the Sahrawi Association for Human Rights (ASDH), in cooperation with other local human rights organizations. The aim of the run was to raise money for charity, and to call attention to the human rights situation in Western Sahara.

The Western Sahara is a disputed territory located in North Africa. It has been occupied by Morocco since 1975, when Spain withdrew from the region. The Polisario Front, a Sahrawi nationalist movement, is fighting for independence from Morocco. There are also numerous reports of human rights violations in the territory, including arbitrary arrests, torture, and forced disappearances.

The Poker Run was part of a week-long series of events organized by ASDH to commemorate International Human Rights Day on December 10th. "This year's theme is 'Justice Matters,'" said Mohamed Lamine Haidar, president of ASDH. "We are raising awareness about the human rights situation in Western Sahara and calling for justice for the victims."

The participants in the Poker Run were given a map of the route, which took them through several towns and villages in western Sahara. Along the way they stopped at checkpoints where they had to answer questions about human rights abuses in the territory. The event raised more than 2,000 euros for charity.

"This was a very important event," said Haidar. "It showed that people from all walks of life are united in their support for human rights in Western Sahara."
