#  What is their home ground like?

Each AFL club has their own home ground where they play their home games. The dimensions and layout of the ground can differ significantly between clubs, but all grounds have some shared features.

All grounds have a playing surface that is rectangular in shape, with Bank or Grandstands running along either long side of the ground. The playing surface is normally covered in grass, with a dirt running track around the outside of the playing surface. There are also normally several large electronic scoreboards located around the ground.

The traditional dimensions of an Australian football ground are 150 metres long by 100 metres wide. However, there is significant variation between clubs, with some grounds having smaller or larger dimensions. For example, the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) - home ground of the Melbourne Demons - has dimensions of 172 metres long by 138 metres wide, while Sydney's ANZ Stadium - home ground of the Sydney Swans - has dimensions of 158 metres long by 104 metres wide.

Most AFL clubs make some use of their home ground's unique features to help give them an advantage over their opponents.
