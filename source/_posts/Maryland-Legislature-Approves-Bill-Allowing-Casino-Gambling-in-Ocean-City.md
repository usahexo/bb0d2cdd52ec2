#  Maryland Legislature Approves Bill Allowing Casino Gambling in Ocean City




The Maryland state legislature has given final approval to a bill that would allow casino gambling in the city of Ocean City. The measure now goes to Governor Larry Hogan for his signature.



The bill, which was introduced by Senator Jim Mathias, would allow for the construction of up to two casinos in Ocean City. In order for a casino to be built, the owner would have to get approval from both the local municipality and the state gaming commission.



Supporters of the bill believe that it will help increase tourism in Ocean City. They point to studies that show that casino gambling is responsible for generating billions of dollars in economic activity each year.



Opponents of the bill argue that casino gambling is harmful to society and leads to addiction and other social ills.

#  Ocean City Officials Applaud Passage of Casino Gambling Legislation

The mayor and city council of Ocean City, Maryland are applauding the state's General Assembly for passing casino gambling legislation. The new law allows for construction of a new casino in Worcester County, about 50 miles from the popular beach town.

"This is great news for Ocean City and for Maryland," said Mayor Rick Meehan. "The new casino will create jobs and generate revenue for our state, and it will be a boost for our local economy."

City Council President Dennis Dare agreed, saying, "This is a positive development for Ocean City and for Maryland. We look forward to seeing the benefits this new casino will bring to our community."

Ocean City officials say the new casino will complement the town's thriving tourism industry. In addition to its world-famous beaches, the town features a variety of restaurants, hotels, and shopping options.

"We are very excited about this new development," said Meehan. "It will help us continue to grow and prosper as one of the premier beach towns in the country."

#  First Casino Set to Open in Ocean City Before the End of the Year

Ocean City is a small town on the coast of New Jersey that is set to get its first casino before the end of the year. The casino, which will be called Ocean Casino Resort, is expected to generate around $50 million in revenue for the town each year. This is great news for Ocean City, as it has been struggling to find ways to generate revenue in recent years.

The casino resort will have 400 hotel rooms, a spa, and a variety of restaurants and bars. It will also have a gaming area that features slot machines, blackjack tables, and poker rooms. The casino is expected to create 1,000 jobs in Ocean City, which is great news for the local economy.

This is not the only development that is happening in Ocean City right now. A new boardwalk amusement park called OC Waterpark is slated to open next spring. The park will feature a dozen water slides, a lazy river, and a number of other attractions. It is expected to attract around 500,000 visitors each year.

These two developments are sure to help revive the economy of Ocean City and bring thousands of tourists to the town each year.

#  Maryland's New Casino Legislation Expected to Boost Tourism Industry

The opening of two new casinos in Maryland is expected to boost the state’s tourism industry. The Hollywood Casino in Perryville and the MGM National Harbor casino near Washington, D.C., are expected to create thousands of jobs and generate over $1 billion for the state economy.

Governor Martin O’Malley signed legislation authorizing the casinos in 2012. The casinos are being developed by Caesars Entertainment Corporation and MGM Resorts International. Construction on the casinos is expected to create 10,000 jobs.

The casinos are expected to attract tourists from surrounding states, including Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia, and Delaware. The Hollywood Casino is located only an hour from Philadelphia and Baltimore, while the MGM National Harbor casino is only a short drive from Washington, D.C.

Tourism is a key part of Maryland’s economy, generating over $10 billion in revenue each year. In addition to the new casinos, the state is also home to many popular tourist destinations, including Ocean City, Annapolis, and Frederick County.

#  Plans for Multiple Casinos in Ocean City Moves Forward

The town of Ocean City, Maryland is working on a plan that would allow for multiple casinos within its borders. Officials say this would be a major redevelopment project that would bring in much-needed revenue to the town.

Details are still being worked out, but it is expected that the casinos would be located in different parts of the town. This would help to spread out the potential impacts, both positive and negative, of having casinos in Ocean City.

One of the biggest concerns about bringing casinos to Ocean City is the impact they could have on tourism. Some people fear that tourists will start to avoid the town if it becomes known as a gambling destination.

Town officials are confident that they can mitigate these risks by marketing Ocean City as a family-friendly resort town with plenty to offer visitors of all ages. They also point out that there are already several casinos within driving distance of Ocean City, so it’s not like the town is without gaming options.

In addition to creating jobs and bringing in new revenue, officials believe that casino development will help to revitalize some of the areas of Ocean City that need it most. There is already a lot of interest in the proposed project, so it looks like casino gambling is coming to Ocean City sooner rather than later.
