#  7Bit Casino Offers Over 4.3 Quintillion Ways to Win with Five-Card Poker Hands!

April 1, 2019 – 7Bit Casino is proud to announce the launch of its new and improved Five-Card Poker game. The game offers players over 4.3 quintillion ways to win, making it the most exciting and rewarding way to play poker online!

7Bit Casino’s new Five-Card Poker is played with a deck of 52 cards, which are ranked according to their face value. The Ace is the highest rank and the Two is the lowest. In addition, there are five card suits: Spades, Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds, and better.

To begin a game of Five-Card Poker, all players must place an Ante bet. Once all bets are placed, the Dealer will deal five cards face up to each player and five cards face down in the middle of the table (the Flop). Each player will now have seven total cards (five face up and two hidden).

The aim of the game is to make the best five-card poker hand from your seven cards. You can use any combination of your five face-up cards and two hidden cards. The best possible poker hand is a Royal Flush – A, K, Q, J, 10 of the same suit.

Once you have determined your best five-card poker hand, you must decide whether to ‘fold’ or ‘call’. If you fold, you forfeit your Ante bet and leave the game. If you call, you must place another bet equal to twice your Ante bet (the Call Bet). The Dealer then reveals his/her five cards (the Turn and River).

The Dealer must have at least a pair of Queens or higher in order to qualify for play. If the Dealer does not qualify (having just a pair of Jacks or lower), all remaining players who called are automatically awarded even money on their Ante bet (1:1) and their Call Bet is also returned. If the Dealer qualifies with a better hand than the player(s), the player(s) lose both their Ante bet and Call Bet. In case of a tie, both players push (neither wins nor loses).

7Bit Casino’s new Five-Card Poker offers players some of the best odds in online casino gaming! There is never any need to worry about overcrowded tables or lengthy waiting times – games start quickly and every player gets their own individual seat! So come join us at 7Bit Casino today for some exciting online poker action!

Players, it’s time to up your game. 7Bit Casino has just released an all new poker game called Royal Flush that is guaranteed to give you a royal flush every time. How’s that for a winning hand? This new game offers unique and exciting features that are sure to get your pulse racing. Here are just a few of them:

#  5 Card Poker Hands: How Many Are There? 
There are 10,000 different five-card poker hands. This may sound like a lot, but it really isn’t. If you consider that there are only 52 cards in a deck and that each hand is composed of five cards, then the odds of getting any particular hand are 1 in 2,598,960. 

This means that if you were to play poker every day for the rest of your life, you would expect to get each of the 10,000 possible hands only once. Of course, this doesn’t take into account all of the other factors that go into winning a poker game – such as how your opponents play and whether you are playing against one or more other players. 

Now that we know how many different five-card poker hands there are, let’s take a look at some of the most common ones. The most common hand is two pair, which happens about 1 in 42 times. Next is three of a kind, which occurs about 1 in 110 times. You are less likely to get a full house (1 in 654) or four of a kind (1 in 4,164). The odds of getting a straight flush are about 1 in 3 million and the odds of getting a royal flush are approximately 1 in 649,739. 

Keep in mind that these probabilities are based on a single deck of cards. If you are playing with multiple decks, the chances of getting certain hands will change. For example, because there are more potential straight flush hands when multiple decks are used, the odds of getting one increase from about 1 in 3 million to about 1 in 2.6 million

#  Discover the Ins and Outs of 7Bit Casino’s Exciting New Poker Game

7Bit Casino has just launched a brand new poker game and it is already taking the online gambling world by storm. The new game, which goes by the name of 7 BitPoker, is an exciting and innovative take on traditional poker that offers players a truly unique gaming experience. If you are curious about what this new game has to offer, then read on to discover the ins and outs of 7BitPoker.

As its name suggests, 7 BitPoker is based on traditional poker but with a few interesting twists that make it stand out from the crowd. Firstly, all players are given seven cards at the start of the game instead of the usual five. This not only gives players more options when it comes to forming hands, but also adds an extra layer of excitement to the gameplay.

Another unique feature of 7 BitPoker is the fact that there is no limit to how many times you can bet during any given hand. This means that you can raise as many times as you like during a hand in order to increase your chances of winning. However, it also means that you can end up losing a lot of money if you are not careful!

One final thing worth mentioning about 7 BitPoker is that all hands are played as heads-up matches. This means that there is always someone else at the table who is just as desperate to win as you are!
